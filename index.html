   <p> Ukiyo-e is a genre of Japanese art that flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica. The term ukiyo-e (浮世絵) translates as 'pictures of the floating world'.

    In 1603, the city of Edo (Tokyo) became the seat of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate. The chōnin class (merchants, craftsmen and workers), positioned at the bottom of the social order, benefited the most from the city's rapid economic growth. They began to indulge in and patronize the entertainment of kabuki theatre, geisha, and courtesans of the pleasure districts. The term ukiyo ('floating world') came to describe this hedonistic lifestyle. Printed or painted ukiyo-e works were popular with the chōnin class, who had become wealthy enough to afford to decorate their homes with them.
    
    The earliest ukiyo-e works emerged in the 1670s, with Hishikawa Moronobu's paintings and monochromatic prints of beautiful women. Colour prints were introduced gradually, and at first were only used for special commissions. By the 1740s, artists such as Okumura Masanobu used multiple woodblocks to print areas of colour. In the 1760s, the success of Suzuki Harunobu's "brocade prints" led to full-colour production becoming standard, with ten or more blocks used to create each print. Some ukiyo-e artists specialized in making paintings, but most works were prints. Artists rarely carved their own woodblocks for printing; rather, production was divided between the artist, who designed the prints; the carver, who cut the woodblocks; the printer, who inked and pressed the woodblocks onto handmade paper; and the publisher, who financed, promoted, and distributed the works. As printing was done by hand, printers were able to achieve effects impractical with machines, such as the blending or gradation of colours on the printing block.
    
    Specialists have prized the portraits of beauties and actors by masters such as Torii Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku that were created in the late 18th century. The 19th century also saw the continuation of masters of the ukiyo-e tradition, with the creation of Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa, one of the most well-known works of Japanese art, and Hiroshige's The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō. Following the deaths of these two masters, and against the technological and social modernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868, ukiyo-e production went into steep decline.
    
    However, in the 20th century there was a revival in Japanese printmaking: the shin-hanga ('new prints') genre capitalized on Western interest in prints of traditional Japanese scenes, and the sōsaku-hanga ('creative prints') movement promoted individualist works designed, carved, and printed by a single artist. Prints since the late 20th century have continued in an individualist vein, often made with techniques imported from the West.
    
    Ukiyo-e was central to forming the West's perception of Japanese art in the late 19th century, particularly the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige. From the 1870s onward, Japonisme became a prominent trend and had a strong influence on the early French Impressionists such as Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet and Claude Monet, as well as influencing Post-Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh, and Art Nouveau artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. And in this article we will be discussing the famous & influential ukiyo-e artist's and analyzing a few of his work over the years.</p>

    <p> 歌川 国芳 (Utagawa Kuniyoshi) Born in 1797 in Edo and passing away on April 14, 1861, Kuniyoshi's early life remains somewhat veiled in mystery. His father, a silk dyer, named the boy Yoshisaburo.

        Showing a proclivity for drawing from an early age, young Yoshisaburo pursued his passion fervently. At the age of 14, he embarked on his artistic journey, joining the renowned Utagawa school, which was then under the tutelage of the esteemed ukiyo-e master Toyokuni Utagawa (1769 - 1825). Alternative sources suggest prior training under Katsukawa Shuntei.
        
        Recognizing his pupil's talent, Toyokuni bestowed upon the young Yoshisaburo the name Kuniyoshi. It was customary for students entering an art school to receive a new artist name connected to the master's name. Kuniyoshi's name was derived from the conclusion of Toyokuni's name, kuni, merged with the commencement of the boy's name, Yoshisaburo, resulting in the appellation Kuniyoshi Utagawa.
        
        Following his departure from the Utagawa School, Kuniyoshi encountered considerable challenges establishing himself as a ukiyo-e designer. He even endured periods where he sustained himself by repairing and selling floor mats.</p>

        <p>Hishikawa Moronobu (born 1618, Yasuda, Japan—died 1694, Edo [now Tokyo]) was a Japanese printmaker, the first great master of ukiyo-e (“pictures of the floating world”), a genre depicting entertainment districts and other scenes of urban life. 

            The son of a provincial embroiderer, Hishikawa started by drawing designs for embroidery. About the middle of the 17th century he moved to Edo, where he became an illustrator of storybooks using wood-block prints, and he developed a technique for the mass reproduction of paintings to make them accessible to a large public. He continued to make pictures that were not to be reproduced as prints. Both his paintings and his prints depicted the customs and manners of the Edo people, especially of courtesans and Kabuki theatre actors. Among his works were the scroll The Gay Quarters and the Kabuki Theatre, the 12 ichimai-e (single-sheet print) series Scenes from the Gay Quarters at Yoshiwara, and the famous ichimai-e Beauty Looking Back.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Tōshūsai Sharaku</h2>

        <p>Tōshūsai Sharaku (flourished 1794–95, Japan) was one of the most original Japanese artists of the Ukiyo-e movement (paintings and prints of the “floating world”).

            Tōshūsai is said to have been a nō actor in Awa province (now Tokushima prefecture). His extant works consist of fewer than 160 prints, chiefly of actors. These prints of actors, especially the okubi-e, or half-length portraits, are striking for their intensity and for an exaggeration verging on caricature. Unlike other Ukiyo-e artists, Sharaku did not make idealized portraits but tried to penetrate the actors’ characters and to show them in poses revealing their ways of acting. Even the most handsome actor of the time, Matsumoto Yonesaburō, who played female roles, appears in Sharaku’s portrait as a thick-necked, ungainly male.
            
            Sharaku was not a very popular artist; only after his work became highly regarded by Westerners was he fully recognized by the Japanese. He used a mica ground with black sheen for his portraits until the practice was prohibited by the government.</p>
